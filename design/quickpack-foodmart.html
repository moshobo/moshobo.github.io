            <p>
                For as long as I can rememeber, I have had an artistic drive. It started out doing sketches as a young kid,
                and I continuted to experiment with other mediums at a young age. In high school, I was really into photography 
                and took AP 2D art with photography and graphic design as my medium.<br><br>

                As I pursued my Mechanical Engineering BSc. at Rice University, I continued to keep art in my life by designing 
                college apparrel and working as the branding manager for our campus bike shop.<br><br>

                When I graduated from Rice in 2020, I started my career in Quality Engineering. While you might think that the 
                role is far from what a UX designer might do, both have overlap in that we think in the mindset of our userbase. 
                I was able to transition into a UX role in April 2023, and have enjoyed the challenges this line of work brings.

                    <h2>New Logo</h2>
                    <p>The new logo aims to highlight key information about the business quickly.<br><br>

                        The first thing that pops out is the name of the business; can’t go wrong here. I used a stroke on the words “Taco Truck” so that they gained attention without taking away from the star of the show. I think that this piece of information is critical to helping potential customers gather context for what they’re about to see on the menu.<br><br>
                        
                        Above the businesses name are four popular menu items. This further communicates to potential customers what type of service they would expect.<br><br>
                        
                        Finally, the very bottom contains the address and operating days for the taco truck. If the reader has worked up an appetite by reading the other information, they will likely want to know when and where they can get some great food. I placed a single stroke zig-zag line above this information to help give form to the text, but also because this stroke-based design element is repeated in other parts of the graphic package.

                    <h2>Menu Specials</h2>
                    <p>Specials are a great way to highlight new items on the menu<br><br>

                        This design uses iconography via the star to signify the uniqueness of this menu item. The icon works with the stroke-only text to give a different hierarchy when compared to the bold white font of the name of the dish.<br><br>
                        
                        Secondary information, like the ingredients, use a smaller font size which helps to accommodate the long list of items.

                    <p>The original menu left...a lot to be desired. It was simply written on various pieces of construction paper which had managed to enure the heat of the kitchen and the cool and wet Seattle climate.</p>
