            <h1>Taqueria Sotelo</h1>
            <p>This taco truck is one of my favorites in all of Seattle. They serve up great food at great prices with a smile.<br><br>After ordering from here a number of times, I did begin to notice that their menu suffered from usability issues, mainly due to the unorganized nature of the information and the additional wear-and-tear from all the years they've been open.<br><br>As part of a personal project, I decided to explore what a new and updated menu for Taqueria Sotelo might look like.</p>
            <div class="image-text-container">

                <div>
                    <h2>Original Menu Design</h2>
                    <p>The original menu left...a lot to be desired. It was simply written on various pieces of construction paper which had managed to enure the heat of the kitchen and the cool and wet Seattle climate.</p>
                </div>
            </div>
            <div class="image-text-container">
                <img src="../data/images/gd_taqueriasotelo_tile.jpg">
                <div>
                    <h2>New Logo</h2>
                    <p>The new logo aims to highlight key information about the business quickly.<br><br>

                        The first thing that pops out is the name of the business; can’t go wrong here. I used a stroke on the words “Taco Truck” so that they gained attention without taking away from the star of the show. I think that this piece of information is critical to helping potential customers gather context for what they’re about to see on the menu.<br><br>
                        
                        Above the businesses name are four popular menu items. This further communicates to potential customers what type of service they would expect.<br><br>
                        
                        Finally, the very bottom contains the address and operating days for the taco truck. If the reader has worked up an appetite by reading the other information, they will likely want to know when and where they can get some great food. I placed a single stroke zig-zag line above this information to help give form to the text, but also because this stroke-based design element is repeated in other parts of the graphic package.

                    <h2>Menu Specials</h2>
                    <p>Specials are a great way to highlight new items on the menu<br><br>

                        This design uses iconography via the star to signify the uniqueness of this menu item. The icon works with the stroke-only text to give a different hierarchy when compared to the bold white font of the name of the dish.<br><br>
                        
                        Secondary information, like the ingredients, use a smaller font size which helps to accommodate the long list of items.
