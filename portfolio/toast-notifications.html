            </div>
            <p>ExtraHop is a cybersecurity tool that users access through their browser. The system not only visualizes data, but allows users to make a number of configurations and changes from within the user interface. This project focuses on redesigning the visual and interactive design of notifications to help convey information about these changes to users.</p>

                <h2>Design Problem</h2>
                <hr>
            </div>
            <p>Many years ago, when ExtraHop was a newly founded start up, somebody added <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pop-up_notification" target="_blank">toast notifications</a> in the system. While the intention was in the right place, the implementation was poor at best.<br><br>One issue was that the toast notifications were ALWAYS YELLOW! No matter if the message was conveying a success, error, or warning, the toast notification always appeared in yellow. Additionally, the behavior of the notifications was inconsistent and could sometimes result in a chain of toast notifications covering the screen creating a waterfall effect.<br><br>Something had to be done!</p>

                <hr>
            </div>
            <p>By reviewing the industry standards for toast notifications, I determined that ExtraHop’s UI could do a better job of communicating information to users. A more familiar and predictable interface would allow users to navigate the product with ease and confidence.</p>

            </div>
            <h4>Industry Standards</h4>
            <p>To begin this design process, I researched industry standards for implementing toast notifications. I reviewed the design guidelines for Google’s material.io, Hewlett Packard, and Adobe. From these resources, I gathered the following general guidelines:</p>
            <div>
                <ul>
                    <li>Toast notifications should be short-lived, with a maximum lifetime of 8 seconds (<a href="https://m3.material.io/components/snackbar/overview" target="_blank">Material Design (Google)</a>, <a href="https://design-system.hpe.design/templates/toast-notifications" target="_blank">Hewlett Packard Enterprise</a>)</li>
                    <li>Notifications should never be the only way for a user to see a piece of information; instead use them to reassure a user about an action they have just completed (<a href="https://design-system.hpe.design/templates/toast-notifications" target="_blank">Hewlett Packard Enterprise</a>)</li>
                    <li>Toast notifications should be simple; users should be able to read them in 2 seconds (<a href="https://m3.material.io/components/snackbar/overview" target="_blank">Material Design (Google)</a>, <a href="https://spectrum.adobe.com/page/toast/" target="_blank">Adobe</a>)</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            <h4>Review of Existing Implementation</h4>
            <p>After gathering a few general guidelines, I reviewed our product’s implementation. I particularly focused on reviewing defect and support tickets that had been filed over the years related to toast notifications. I found that our product broke many of the guidelines that I had previously researched.</p><br><br>
            <p>One issue that spanned all of our toast notifications was that there was a <i>lot</i> of text, breaking the “keep it simple” rule. Quite a few notifications had redundant text, telling the user the same piece of information in both the header and body of the notification. There were also wordy error notifications that would vaguely suggest contacting the “Administrator”.</p>
            <img src="../data/images/toast-old-toasts.png">
            <p>Another pitfall of the existing design was <i>Notification Waterfalls</i>. Having an expiry time for notifications was optional, so there were a number of cases where the notifications would live longer than the recommended 8 seconds. Additionally, new notifications did not dismiss those before them, leading to a cascading list of toast notifications that would completely fill the right side of the screen.</p>
            <img src="../data/images/toast-old-toasts-2.png">
            <h4>Ideation</h4>
            <p>The next step in the process was to reimagine what toast notifications should look like in our new system. One of the elements I decided to analyze was the toast notification’s placement within the browser. Traditionally, ExtraHop’s toast notifications were placed in the upper-right corner. However, after reviewing designs from Hewlett Packard, I evaluated placing them in the center of the page.</p>
            <h5>Center Aligned</h5>
            <p>Placing the notification in the middle of the viewport offers a number of advantages over the current placement on the right side of the page. First, there is only one page in the product’s UI that contains centered interactive elements, reducing the risk of overlapping content. Second, a notification placed in the center is more likely to catch the user’s eye. On the other hand, there is the limited amount of horizontal space which wouldn’t allow long text strings to work well.</p>
            <img class="image-container" src="../data/images/toast-placement-center.png">
            <h5>Right Aligned</h5>
            <p>Keeping the toast notifications on the right side has many benefits. It provides predictability for existing users, and also requires less development work to make existing pages compatible. However, with this placement, other content on the page would frequently be temporarily obscured.</p>
            <img class="image-container" src="../data/images/toast-placement-right.png">
            <h5>Wire Framing</h5>
            <p>After deciding that center placement would work better with most of the UI, I spent time completing wireframes of the new design. I elaborated on the edge cases of this design where there were obscured buttons or exceptionally long text strings. I completed this wireframing exercise on our various page layouts to get a full understanding of all the changes.</p>
            <img src="../data/images/toast-placement-center-dual.png">
            <h4>Design Review</h4>
            <p>With my research and low-fidelity designs finished, I presented the findings to the rest of the UX team. In our discussion, we reviewed our past implementations and where we didn’t align with industry best practices. We also discussed the pros and cons of the placement options, and started to expand upon what else we could do with toast notifications. For example, what would this new element look like if there were buttons or if we decided to include a status icon?</p>

                <h2>Solution</h2>
                <hr>
            </div>
            <p>The final implementation featured a number of changes to bring ExtraHop’s toast notifications up to industry standard.<br><br>Here are more details about the final design elements:</p>
            <h4>Information Layout</h4>
            <p>Toast notifications now feature a single text body; gone are the redundant headers. Working with our technical writers, we reduced the number of words used in these messages.</p>
            <img src="../data/images/toast-new-old.png">
            <h4>Theming</h4>
            <p>The new design moves away from the glaring sunshine-yellow and instead sets the color of the toast notification to match the system's theme.</p>
            <img src="../data/images/toast-light-dark.jpg">
            <h4>Behavior</h4>
            <p>Finally, the code was updated to have a hard limit of 8 seconds per toast notification. Working with our technical writers, I created a standard not only for how text should read in toast notifications but how long notifications should last. For example, simple one-word confirmations like “Saved” or “Deleted” only needed to be around for 4 seconds. A more complex error should remain until the 8 second limit.</p>

                <h2>Implementation</h2>
                <hr>
            </div>
            <p>Due to limited front end developers, I coded these design changes! The work was split across two merge requests. The first dealt with changing the design elements of toast notification within the appropriate typescript files. I implemented the color changes and added the maximum timeout for all notifications.<br><br>The second merge request was more tedious. It involved reviewing every case where we had implemented toast notifications in the past throughout many i18n text files. I worked with a technical writer to fit each message to our new wording framework so that they matched our new, simpler style guide.</p>

            <p>With some of the full design elements shelved, I hope to further enhance toast notifications in the future by adding additional information like status, actions, and more!</p>
