        <h1>About me</h1>
        <p>
            For as long as I can rememeber, I have had an artistic drive. It started out doing sketches as a young kid,
            and I continuted to experiment with other mediums at a young age. In high school, I was really into photography 
            and took AP 2D art with photography and graphic design as my medium.<br><br>

            As I pursued my Mechanical Engineering BSc. at Rice University, I continued to keep art in my life by designing 
            college apparrel and working as the branding manager for our campus bike shop.<br><br>

            When I graduated from Rice in 2020, I started my career in Quality Engineering. While you might think that the 
            role is far from what a UX designer might do, both have overlap in that we think in the mindset of our userbase. 
            I was able to transition into a UX role in April 2023, and have enjoyed the challenges this line of work brings.
